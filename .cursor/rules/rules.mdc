# Cursor Rules for Frontier Finder Project

## Project Context

This is a web application to find Frontier People Groups (FPGs) and Unreached People Groups (UUPGs) within a specified proximity of a selected UPG.

## Project Details

This is a project for Crossover Global.  I'm using the Joshua Project API to get the data.  I'm using the Crossover Global Brand Book to guide the design and branding of the project.

The project is a static website that will be deployed through github pages.  I will go by any recommendations you might have as long as they are simple and easy to implement through github pages.

The project is a siple three page application that will be deployed through github pages.  I will go by any recommendations you might have as long as they are simple and easy to implement through github pages.

The  opening page will have two dropdown menus for the user to select a Country from a the current_upgs.csv file.  Once the country has been selected the user will select a UPG from a dropdown menu of the UPGs in that country.  Once the UPG has been selected the user will select a distance in either miles from the UPG (determined by clicking a Miles/Kilometers radio button).  Once the distance has been selected the user will choose to search FPG (Frontier People Group or FPG's), UUPG's (Unreached Unengaged People Groups), or Both by selecting one of three radio buttons.  If they want to search for FPG's that data will come from the Joshua Project API.  If they want to search for UUPG's that data will come from uupgs.csv file.  The user will then click a button to search for FPGs, UUPGs or both within that distance.  The results will be displayed on the results.html page.  

Once results have been populated, the user will have the option of selecting one or more FPG or UUPG from the list of results by clicking on the checkbox next to the FPG or UUPG.  The user will then click a button to save the selected FPG(s) or UUPG(s) to the list on the top100.html page.  Once they click on Save to TOP 100 List, the user will then be taken to the the list of favorites on the top100.html page.  On the top100.html page the user will see a list of the top 100 UUPG's and/or FPG's which will each have a delete button allowing the user to delete the FPG or UUPG from the list.

## Key Terms and Definitions

- **FPG (Frontier People Group)**: Less than 0.1% Christian and no evidence of a self-sustaining gospel movement
- **UUPG (Unengaged Unreached People Group)**: No active church planting methodology underway
- **UPG (Unreached People Group)**: Less than 2% Evangelical Christian
- **JPScale**: Joshua Project Progress Scale (1.1 to 3.2)

## Code Style Guidelines

I'm new to all things coding, so I'm not sure what the best practices are. I'm using the code style guidelines from the Joshua Project.  You can see the docs in Cursor Chat and Composer. You can also feel free to recommend any other code style guidelines.

## Testing Requirements

I'm not sure what the best practices are for testing. I'm using the testing guidelines from the Joshua Project. You can see the docs in Cursor Chat and Composer. You can also feel free to recommend any other testing guidelines.

## Performance Guidelines

I'm not sure what the best practices are for performance. I'm using the performance guidelines from the Joshua Project. You can see the docs in Cursor Chat and Composer. You can also feel free to recommend any other performance guidelines.

## Security Rules

I'm not sure what the best practices are for security. I'm using the security guidelines from the Joshua Project. You can see the docs in Cursor Chat and Composer. You can also feel free to recommend any other security guidelines.  We will have a .env file for API keys.  We might also have a firebaseconfig.js file for firebase. I will go by your recommendations.

## Browser Support

- Chrome (latest 2 versions)
- Firefox (latest 2 versions)
- Safari (latest 2 versions)
- Edge (latest version)

## Deployment Process

I'm going to be using a basic static structure and deploying through github pages so simple is best here.  I will go by any recommendations you might have as longn as they are simple and easy to implement through github pages.

### Logo

#### PRIMARY

##### MEANINGS

The logo is composed of a symbol and two words.
The symbol consists of a circle with an arrow through the middle. The group represents the world and Jesus’s commandment as
described in Matthew 28:19 “Therefore go and make disciples of all nations...” (NIV)
The word “Crossover” has three meanings. First, as a an organization we want to cross over geographic, linguistic, cultural and
religious barriers with the gospel which is the message of salvation in Jesus Christ. Second, we seek to elevate and exalt the cross
of Christ over the nations, over the peoples, so that (third) people may be reconciled with the Lord, when they cross over from the
darkness into Christ’s wonderful light (1 Peter 2:9).
The word “Global” refers both to whom and how the organization serves: we are a global team serving peoples around the globe.

#### Photography and Video

It is recommended to use images that refect the peoples and cultures in which Crossover Global serves. Below are some examples.

- After making changes, ALWAYS make sure to start up a new server so I can test it.
- Always look for existing code to iterate on instead of creating new code.
- Do not drastically change the patterns before trying to iterate on existing patterns.
- Always kill all existing related servers that may have been created in previous testing before trying to start a new server.
- Always prefer simple solutions
- Avoid duplication of code whenever possible, which means checking for other areas of the codebase that might already have similar code and functionality
- Write code that takes into account the different environments: dev, test, and prod
- You are careful to only make changes that are requested or you are confident are well understood and related to the change being requested
- When fixing an issue or bug, do not introduce a new pattern or technology without first exhausting all options for the existing implementation. And if you finally do this, make sure to remove the old implementation afterwards so we don't have duplicate logic.
- Keep the codebase very clean and organized
- Avoid writing scripts in files if possible, especially if the script is likely only to be run once
- Avoid having files over 200-300 lines of code. Refactor at that point.
- Mocking data is only needed for tests, never mock data for dev or prod
- Never add stubbing or fake data patterns to code that affects the dev or prod environments
- Never overwrite my .env file without first asking and confirming
- Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task
- Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task
- Write thorough tests for all major functionality
- Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how a feature works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicitly instructed
- Always think about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by code changes
