      }
    }
  }
  ```

PRIMARY

MEANINGS

HORIZONTAL

The logo is composed of a symbol and two words.
The symbol consists of a circle with an arrow through the middle. The group represents the world and Jesus’s commandment as
described in Matthew 28:19 “Therefore go and make disciples of all nations...” (NIV)
The word “Crossover” has three meanings. First, as a an organization we want to cross over geographic, linguistic, cultural and
religious barriers with the gospel which is the message of salvation in Jesus Christ. Second, we seek to elevate and exalt the cross
of Christ over the nations, over the peoples, so that (third) people may be reconciled with the Lord, when they cross over from the
darkness into Christ’s wonderful light (1 Peter 2:9).
The word “Global” refers both to whom and how the organization serves: we are a global team serving peoples around the globe.
